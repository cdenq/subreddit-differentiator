askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

askscience,"Hi! My name is Dr. Christine Wilkinson, and I'm a National Geographic Explorer and an expert in human-wildlife interactions, conservation science, and carnivore ecology. I am a member of the [IUCN SSC Hyaena Specialist Group](https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-ssc-hyaena-specialist-group#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20IUCN,hyaenas%2C%20brown%20hyaenas%20and%20aardwolves.) and specialize in spotted hyenas and coyotes- in particular, determining how they move through human-altered landscapes and what drives their interactions with people. For my research, I use tools such as motion sense cameras, GPS collars, remote sensing, and community participatory mapping. I also do quite a bit of science communication and music performance. I've served as a scientific expert (on and off screen) for several past and upcoming productions and recently began a TikTok series called [Queer is Natural](https://www.tiktok.com/@thescrappynaturalist/video/7106496770196409646?_r=1&amp;_t=8ZquZIuK3FS). I am also a co-founder of [Black Mammalogists Week](https://blackmammalogists.com/), and in my ""spare time"" I perform, learn, and teach with [San Francisco Taiko Dojo](https://www.sftaiko.com/). It's one of my missions in life to recognize scientists as kaleidoscopic beings whose diverse experiences and perspectives can improve science and wildlife conservation!

askscience,"Ever since ""The Last of Us"" premiered on HBO earlier this year, we've been bombarded with questions about Cordyceps fungi from our family members, friends, strangers, and even on job interviews! So we figured it would be helpful to do this AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to dive into the biology of these microbes and explain how they wreck their special breed of havoc. Each of us studies a different host/parasite system, so we are excited to share our unique (but still overlapping) perspectives. We'll take your questions, provide information on the current state of research in this field, and yes, we'll even discuss how realistic the scenario presented on the show is. We'll be live starting at 2 PM ET (19 UT). Ask us anything!

With us today are:

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"As I understand it (with my PhD in astronomy, but not in cosmology specifically), cosmic expansion means that space-time itself is expanding. I get the whole ""inflating balloon"" analogy. OK.

I read things about how if the universe has &gt; critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).

The explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force — it should pull stuff back together. Most explainions I read tend to end there. 

But **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to grav. potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.

If a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to ""slow down"" its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).

TL;DR — I think that the statement ""gravity \[should\] slow the universe's expansion"" is fallacious, and yet I see it quoted everywhere\*. What I am misunderstanding?

\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/01/05/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds/), [Harvard](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/newdata/fate.html), many others.

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"Psychedelics are having a moment. After decades of scrutiny and criticism, there has been an explosion in interest in the role for certain psychedelic compounds as therapeutics for specific conditions thanks to a flurry of recent research. But there is also a lot of misinformation about what psychedelics can, and cannot, do. So we're here to try and set the record straight (as well as we can!).

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the therapeutic usage of psychedelics. We'll explain where we are right now in terms of research and clinical practice, and present ideas for where these investigations might lead in the future. Ask us anything!

**NOTE - We will NOT be making diagnoses or providing medical advice, nor will we be discussing policy recommendations.** Our focus is on the science.

With us today are:

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

askscience,"Something like how much of a chemical (lead, PFAS, acetaminophen, malathion, etc) on a daily basis, will eventually raise your risk of the associated serious health issue (neurological damage, compromised immune system, liver damage, etc.) significantly above the background level, over the course of your lifetime.

Bruce Ames (father of the Ames test for mutagenicity) advocated for the idea of ""Carcinogenic Potency"" in weighting health risks of different chemicals.  This takes into account both the mutagenicity and the level of exposure:  alcohol is only slightly mutagenic, but taking into account the much higher amount typically consumed, it was the the most potent carcinogen outside of smoking in his analysis.  But that's just for cancer.  

Now we are considering limiting PFAS in drinking water to 4 parts per trillion.  But the FDA already allows up to 8 ppm of the pesticide, Malathion, in some foods: 6 orders of magnitude more.  Does that really reflect the difference in risk?","Is there some kind of overall, long term health risk index, to compare different chemicals?

askscience,"The [Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution](https://tempo.si.edu/overview.html) (TEMPO) instrument is a partnership between [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/langley/) and the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) that will provide new insight into air quality in North America. TEMPO, [which launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier this month](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-high-resolution-air-quality-control-instrument-launches), will monitor and report on levels of nitrogen dioxide, aerosols, and other pollutants several times a day.

TEMPO is the first-ever space-based instrument to measure air pollution over North America and will transform the way scientists observe air quality from space. TEMPO's observations of pollutants will take place during daylight hours and will have incredible and unprecedented accuracy-down to four square miles.

This data will play an important role in how scientists study and analyze pollution, including studies of rush hour pollution, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, how pollution spreads from forest fires and volcanoes, and even the effects of applying fertilizer.

Ask us anything about TEMPO!

We are:

+ James Crawford, Senior Scientist for Atmospheric Chemistry, NASA Langley Research Center - JC
+ Laura Judd, Research Scientist, NASA Langley Research Center - LJ
+ Gonzalo Gonzalez, Physicist, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics - GG
+ Xiong Liu, Physicist, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics - XL

Ask us anything, including:

+ What's in the air we breathe, from aerosols to oxygen and everything in between
+ What air quality is, how we measure it, and why it's important
+ How TEMPO will observe air quality over North America
+ What data we're expecting to see from TEMPO's observations

askscience,"These chemicals in your blood may cause autism (#7 will surprise you!)

If you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.

And yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.

In my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a ""safe"" low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.

I am happy to answer all your questions! I will be on today at 12pm US EST (16 UT) until at least 5pm (21 UT). AMA!

askscience,"Hi, I'm Melanie McField, Founder and Director of the [Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative](https://www.healthyreefs.org/cms/) (HRI), a multi-institutional effort comprising 73 partner organizations working to conserve the Mesoamerican Reef. Operating in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, we track the health of the reefs in the area and evaluate each country's reef management efforts. I have a PhD in Marine Science from the University of South Florida and have also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian Institution. I'm the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers and the recipient of the 2021 Conservation Award from the International Coral Reef Society.

In 2013, an uncharted coral reef was discovered off the coast of Belize and Guatemala - but was kept rather secret until this year. Dubbed ""The Cayman Crown,"" this reef surpasses the size of Manhattan and is a refuge for a vast array of marine life, from schools of yellow jack and blue tang to bottlenose dolphins to the critically endangered - and commercially important - Nassau grouper. While not wholly immune to the dangers that face other reefs, such as overfishing, bleaching and invasive species, this reef's remarkable resilience is likely due to its position on the edge of the Cayman Trench. The hope is that this discovery can mark a new chapter in understanding corals and in saving coral reefs worldwide.

The Cayman Crown was given protected status in 2020 by both Belize and Guatemala, but there is still much to be done to ensure its conservation. You can learn more and see the first-ever footage of the reef in the new PBS *Nature* documentary ""[Treasure of the Caribbean](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-treasure-caribbean/28747/),"" now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything!
